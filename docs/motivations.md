## Why should each DAO have at least one data store?

DAOs produce data and they need a reliable place to store it. It canâ€™t all go on-chain. The responsibilities of the DAO data store are primarily to:

1. Content address data, so it can be used effectively in Ethereum events.
2. Ensure data is available at all times.
3. Retrieve data efficiently upon request.
4. Provide flexible permission systems to write to the DAO data store.
